---------------------------
To build a robust AI-powered candidate matching system and resume parsing functionality for Kibbi’s community-focused hiring platform, we can break down the project into a few key components:

    Resume Parsing: Extract structured data from resumes in multiple formats (PDF, Word, TXT).
    Candidate Matching Algorithm: Implement both filter-based and advanced AI-driven matching using semantic understanding (BERT or similar).
    Data Quality Improvement: Handle incomplete or inconsistent data from job-seekers.
    Integration with i's Platform: Implement APIs to integrate the system with the existing Kibbi platform.
    Documentation: Provide clear documentation and user guides.

Below is an outline of how to approach this project with Python code, leveraging various libraries for NLP and AI-powered resume parsing and matching.
Step 1: Resume Parsing

We'll start by using a popular library called PyPDF2 for PDF parsing, python-docx for Word documents, and Spacy for natural language processing.
Resume Parsing Code

import PyPDF2
import docx
import os
import re
import spacy

# Load Spacy model for NLP
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Function to parse PDF resumes
def parse_pdf_resume(pdf_path):
    with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        text = ""
        for page_num in range(len(reader.pages)):
            text += reader.pages[page_num].extract_text()
    return text

# Function to parse Word resumes
def parse_word_resume(word_path):
    doc = docx.Document(word_path)
    text = ""
    for paragraph in doc.paragraphs:
        text += paragraph.text + "\n"
    return text

# Function to clean and extract structured data from resume text using Spacy
def extract_resume_data(resume_text):
    # Run NLP on the resume text
    doc = nlp(resume_text)

    # Extract name (assuming it's in the first line or similar)
    name = None
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == "PERSON":
            name = ent.text
            break
    
    # Extract contact information (emails and phone numbers)
    email = re.findall(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b', resume_text)
    phone = re.findall(r'\b\d{10}\b', resume_text)  # Assuming 10 digit phone number

    # Extract skills (naive example using predefined skill keywords)
    skills_keywords = ['python', 'java', 'sql', 'communication', 'leadership', 'data science']
    skills = [skill for skill in skills_keywords if skill.lower() in resume_text.lower()]

    # Extract education and experience (simplified example)
    education = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == "ORG"]
    experience = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == "WORK_OF_ART"]  # Could be modified for more accurate extraction

    return {
        "name": name,
        "email": email,
        "phone": phone,
        "skills": skills,
        "education": education,
        "experience": experience,
    }

# Example usage:
pdf_resume_path = "sample_resume.pdf"
word_resume_path = "sample_resume.docx"

# Choose resume format
if pdf_resume_path.endswith('.pdf'):
    resume_text = parse_pdf_resume(pdf_resume_path)
elif word_resume_path.endswith('.docx'):
    resume_text = parse_word_resume(word_resume_path)

# Extract structured data from the resume
resume_data = extract_resume_data(resume_text)
print(resume_data)

Step 2: Candidate Matching Algorithm

We’ll first implement a simple filter-based matching system, followed by semantic matching using an AI model like BERT for deeper understanding.
Basic Filter-based Matching (Keyword Matching)

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def simple_keyword_matching(resume_data, job_description):
    """Matches candidates based on skills and job description."""
    resume_skills = ' '.join(resume_data['skills'])
    job_desc = job_description

    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform([resume_skills, job_desc])

    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(vectors)
    match_score = similarity_matrix[0][1]
    return match_score

# Example Usage
job_description = "Looking for a Python developer with SQL and Data Science skills"
match_score = simple_keyword_matching(resume_data, job_description)
print(f"Match score: {match_score:.2f}")

Advanced Semantic Matching using BERT (Transformers)

You can use a pre-trained BERT model to compute sentence embeddings and match candidates with jobs based on semantic similarity.

from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

# Load the pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

def get_bert_embeddings(text):
    """Returns the BERT embeddings for a given text."""
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    # Use the embeddings from the [CLS] token
    return outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]

def semantic_matching_with_bert(resume_data, job_description):
    """Compute similarity between resume data and job description using BERT."""
    resume_text = ' '.join(resume_data['skills'])
    resume_embedding = get_bert_embeddings(resume_text)
    job_embedding = get_bert_embeddings(job_description)

    # Calculate cosine similarity
    cosine_sim = torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity(resume_embedding, job_embedding)
    return cosine_sim.item()

# Example Usage
semantic_match_score = semantic_matching_with_bert(resume_data, job_description)
print(f"Semantic match score: {semantic_match_score:.2f}")

Step 3: Data Quality Improvement

Handling incomplete or inconsistent data is crucial, especially for newcomer profiles. Some solutions include:

    Data Validation: Ensure that key fields like email, phone number, and skills are valid.
    Data Enrichment: Use external data sources (like LinkedIn or public profiles) to fill in missing fields (e.g., job titles or company names).
    Data Normalization: Normalize job titles, skills, and other attributes to a standard format.

Data Validation Example

def validate_data(resume_data):
    """Check for missing or invalid fields."""
    if not resume_data['email']:
        print("Warning: Missing email")
    if not resume_data['phone']:
        print("Warning: Missing phone number")
    if not resume_data['skills']:
        print("Warning: Missing skills")
    return resume_data

# Example usage
validated_data = validate_data(resume_data)

Step 4: Integration with Kibbi Platform

You'll need to integrate this functionality into Kibbi’s platform. This will involve creating RESTful APIs to allow for dynamic matching and real-time recommendations.

For example, you can use Flask or FastAPI for this purpose.
Example Flask API

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/parse_resume', methods=['POST'])
def parse_resume():
    resume_file = request.files['resume']
    resume_text = extract_resume_data(resume_file.read().decode('utf-8'))
    return jsonify(resume_text)

@app.route('/match_candidate', methods=['POST'])
def match_candidate():
    resume_data = request.json.get('resume_data')
    job_description = request.json.get('job_description')
    
    match_score = simple_keyword_matching(resume_data, job_description)
    return jsonify({"match_score": match_score})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 5: Documentation

Provide clear documentation for:

    API Endpoints: Document the REST API endpoints for resume parsing and candidate matching.
    Data Structures: Define the data formats for resumes and job descriptions.
    Algorithm Details: Explain how the matching algorithms work, including BERT-based semantic matching.

Conclusion

This approach combines traditional keyword matching and advanced AI-based semantic matching using models like BERT. It will allow Kibbi to offer both basic and advanced candidate-job matching functionality. Additionally, you will have an effective resume parser capable of handling multiple formats (PDF, Word, etc.) and dealing with the challenges of incomplete data. This foundation can be integrated into the Kibbi platform via APIs to deliver real-time, dynamic recommendations.
